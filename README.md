#Spring Redis CRUD

This is a simple project to help any one who wants to use redis to store and retrieve information. The main class (redisaccess/RedisService) can be exported and used in your personal project.
If you want to use as a microservice simply compile the project as a jar using mvn package spring-boot:repackage and start the exported jar using java -jar spring-redis-crud-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.
